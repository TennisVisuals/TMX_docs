## Types of Local Data

TMX maintains a local database which includes:
- Tournaments
- Players
- Clubs
- Matches
- Points
- Rankings

Complete tournaments can be exported from the [Tournament Tab](tmx_tournament_information.html) when viewing a tournament; tournaments are exported in JSON format.

Matches can be exported from the [Matches Tab](tmx_tournament_matches.html) when viewing a tournament; matches can be exported in JSON, CSV or UTR (custom CSV) formats.

Points can be exported from the [Points Tab](tmx_tournament_points.html) when viewing a tournament; points can be exported in JSON or custom CSV formats which are specified by [Organization Keys](tmx_configuration.html).

All types of data may be __imported__ in to TMX via Drag/Drop of File Upload.  To add data to the local TMX database select the Import/Export icon from the Home Screen.
