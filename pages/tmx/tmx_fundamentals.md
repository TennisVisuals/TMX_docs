## "Context" menus

The initial version of CourtHive/TMX made extensive use of context menus, but reliance on context menus has been phased out as support for Tablets and Touch Devices has been added.  Context menus are still available and often serve as short cuts for frequent tasks to avoid menus which would otherwise appear.

* Context Menus are accessed by Right Clicking (Windows) or Control Clicking (Mac).
* Example: The icon for publishing can be used to 'un-publish' a draw or a schedule.
