## Simple to use, anywhere!

CourtHive/TMX is a cross-platform, browser-based Tournament Management system which runs in Chrome, Opera, Safari and Firefox (rumored to run in Microsoft Edge), even when there is no internet connection.

## It's an Application, not a Website!

CourtHive/TMX looks like a website, but it is actually an application which runs in a browser and communicates with a server when an internet connection is available.  This means that there are no network latency issues, and that organizers can perform any or all management functions, including printing PDFs of Draws and Schedules, when offline.

## Built in Guided Tours (and Hints)

CourtHive/TMX has built-in context-sensitive tours available throughout the application.

The TMX Tour is always available from the Menu in the upper left corner.
