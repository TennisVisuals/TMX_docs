## Tournament Calendar

The Tournament Calendar is displayed by clicking the Tournament Icon on the home screen.  

The initial view is a two month date range beginning with the __current day__.

{% include tip.html content="Modify the Date Range by editing the __From:__ and __To:__ dates." %}

Any changes made to the calendar filters are retained until the browser is reloaded.

{% include image.html file="ch_tournament_calendar.png" alt="Tournament Calendar" caption="Tournament Calendar" %}

Tournaments which have not yet started or which are active are depicted in <font color='blue'>Blue</font>, while tournaments which have completed are <font color='gray'>Gray</font>. __Bold__ indicates that a tournament record has been downloaded from the CourtHive server.

Tournaments can be filtered by __date__ or __category__.

{% include important.html content="If you don't see a tournament which you have recently created, make sure your tournament dates are between the __From:__ and __To:__ dates." %}

## Defining a Date Range

Click on the __From:__ or __To:__ dates to launch the [Pikaday Datepicker](https://github.com/dbushell/Pikaday).

The datepicker supports arrow-key navigation.  Dates may also be entered in the input box using YYYY-MM-DD format.

{% include tip.html content="Quickly modify __month__ or __year__ by clicking and selecting from drop down menus." %}
